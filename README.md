# PAC-MAN

To give the game a try head over to [Netlify](https://elegant-colden-e32625.netlify.app/).

Use arrow keys to move pac-man around.   
To pause/resume the game hit space.   
That's pretty much it.   
After all it is pac-man, and it is simple.   

// TODO the gameOver function needs some work   
// TODO how to remove the event listeners when the game is over?   
// TODO the speed of pac-man varies when changing direction. Why?
